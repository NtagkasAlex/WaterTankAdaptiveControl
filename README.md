This is a repository developed for the course Adaptive Control and Reinforcement Learning of Prof Ch Bechlioulis.
The purpose of the experiment is to stabilize the water level of a chained water tank system consisting of 2 tanks in total.
We assume no knowledge regarding the parameters of the valves and the tanks and tackle the control task using several adaptive control architectures.
